    <section class="content"><h1>Holly's Story</h1>
        <p> Holly, as well as being in the video, is also our producer. Her passion for this project arose when she found herself joking about how often she was being grabbed in clubs on nights out with friends. She stated “I’m more shocked if I don’t get grabbed on a night out than if I do now at this point”. Girls don’t take it seriously because it happens to them so much now, myself included. It’s time girls realised that we shouldn’t think it’s ‘normal’, girls should be allowed to go out without constantly being aware of men who might touch them." 

She explains the worst encounter she had was “a man pushed me, backing me into a wall of a club. Luckily my friends were there and could stop him. I went to the security and was told “well maybe it’s what you’re wearing” and they laughed it off”. It’s the attitude of society that makes girls think this is ‘just what we have to deal with’, but we shouldn’t, and it’s time to change. </p></section>

    <section class="content"> <h1>Alex's Story</h1>
        <p> 
Alex, alike many other women today, has experienced being followed by men on countless occasions. She tells us that the most memorable situation she has experienced was being followed by an older man for over an hour and a half inside a shopping centre. Upon noticing the man and realising she had seen him frequently for the past 40 minutes, she informed security. They played her the CCTV footage where she proceed to watch this man stalking her into each shop she went to and saw he had been following her for even longer than she had thought. She describes watching this CCTV as “the most awful thing” as she realised the enormity of what had happened. After playing the footage back Alex mentioned that a policeman “brought up the fact that I was in a short skirt, and said that was probably why it happened.” 

If wearing a skirt excuses a man from stalking a young woman for over an hour and a half, then I think it’s about time we take a good look at how our society deals with sexual harassment, don’t you?</p></section>

    <h1>Maria's Story</h1>
        <p> Maria is a university student and experiences catcalling every week. She explains how she is persistently catcalled at a specific place on her way into university. It happens so frequently that although she hates it, she simply accepts that it is going to happen. She says, the fact that it happens so often is “awful, I just feel so uncomfortable even just walking the streets I know so well.” Maria is not the only one. She mentions how not only is she catcalled all the time, she witnesses it happen to other women frequently. She describes these situations saying that they “just make me feel really really insecure and on edge” which is how so many women feel every time they are catcalled by either an individual or group of men. It’s shocking how it is seen as acceptable for men to catcall women on the street and verbally harass them. It’s the 21st century and times are changing, so let’s start acting like it.
